# XRR_Analysis

To analyze and visualize the X-ray reflectivity data of the Langmuir Monolayer samples at the air-water interface.
DWBApproximation applied and no absorption is assumed.
Only use for $\mu=0$ samples.

Designed to
1. Manually add Layers to model EDP for a better manipulation
2. Visualize the slab model EDP, EDP, and log(R/RF) including experimental data and fitting result
3. Parameter Estimation

Parameter includes
1. Layer Thickness $d$ in $\AA$
2. Electron density $\rho$ in number of electrons per $\AA^3$
3. Roughness of the top of the layer in $\AA$. $\sigma_{i}$ is a roughness between $i^{th}$ and ${i+1}^{th}$ layers
